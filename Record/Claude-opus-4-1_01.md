# Story Generator Hub

🎭 A multi-model collaborative story generation platform powered by various LLMs

## 📖 Overview

Story Generator Hub is an innovative platform that leverages multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate diverse story plots, intelligently categorize them, and create complete stories based on user preferences.

## ✨ Features

- **Multi-Model Plot Generation**: Generate diverse story plots using up to 5 different LLM models simultaneously
- **Intelligent Clustering**: Automatically group similar plots using GPT for better organization
- **Interactive Selection**: Users can select preferred plot clusters to guide story generation
- **Collaborative Story Creation**: Generate complete stories using up to 3 models for richer narratives
- **Markdown Export**: All stories are exported in clean Markdown format
- **Random Model Selection**: Option to randomly select models for varied results

## 🚀 How It Works

### Phase 1: Plot Generation
1. Select up to 5 LLM models (or choose random selection)
2. Generate multiple story plots from each model
3. GPT analyzes and clusters similar plots automatically

### Phase 2: Plot Selection
1. Review categorized plot clusters
2. Select preferred plot groups
3. Confirm selections for story generation

### Phase 3: Story Generation
1. Choose up to 3 models for story generation (or random)
2. Generate complete stories based on selected plots
